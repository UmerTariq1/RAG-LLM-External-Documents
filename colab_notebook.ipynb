The main kitchen, including the main fridge but tenants usually buy a small fridge for their room, is shared among the entire floor consisting around 12-15 tenants. According to the Pakistani tenants living there, its rather rare that you find the kitchen completely busy and you have to wait for your turn to cook, very few people actually cook but this can vary. There are two toilets and a dedicated shower area on each end of the hallway. These are shared among (roughly) 6-8 people.\n",
