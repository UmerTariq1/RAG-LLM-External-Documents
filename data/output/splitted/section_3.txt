Suggested airport is Frankfrut. Frankfurt is around 3 hours away from SB by train. Airport and big train stations usually have free wifi. connect to them. Check [https://www.bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de) (DB : Deutsch Bahn / German railway) for train connections. There is an RE which comes directly from Frankfurt to Saarbrucken (SB) every 2 hours. make that your priority. Ask someone who is already in Saarbrucken if they can come pick you up from SB train station and can take you to your home. That way you dont have to worry about the busses here.
There are other options of reaching Saarbrucken as well. For example coming to any other city in Germany and then coming to SB via train. Or landing at Paris and then taking flixbux to SB. Check your options, Take opinions, decide for yourself.
Note: You can enter Germany through any other European country. To quote the visa office:
