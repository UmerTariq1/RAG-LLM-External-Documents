Body:
This LST department is a dept focused on NLP and linguistics. Combining computer side of the linguistics. You can find more details about the dept [here](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html). There isnt any specific GPA requirement for admission but you must have some background in NLP or Linguistics. It is a small but very international and fun department. As of writing this, there are only 2 Pakistani students in the department including the original author of this document (Umer). I would highly recommend joining this department if you are interested in NLP or Linguistics. There are also many student working opportunities within the dept in various research groups.
