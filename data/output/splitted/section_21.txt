Heading 1: Accomodation and Living üèò
Heading 2: how to know which property will allow me to use it for city reg and bank opening?
Body:
Answer: Ask them. usually all the dorms and long-term sublets will allow that. If the property (or a room in a wg) can be on your name then you can do city reg on it. Note that it is possible that a dorm is sublet by a student for some small duration, in that case you cannot do city registeration on that place. So, Just ASK the landlord.
