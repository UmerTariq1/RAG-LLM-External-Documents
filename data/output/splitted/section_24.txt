Heading 1: University Related Stuff üè´
Heading 2: What if I have not found an accomodation and my arrival date is coming up
Body:
Answer: I know many of you have family and/or some other problems due to which you have to travel regardless. But if its in anyway possible please try to get accommodation beforehand do the following.
- Start applying/looking as soon as you can, preferably atleast 6+ months.
- If the time is short between you getting admission, and you coming here, I would suggest to defer your admission.
- If the uni is forcing you to come regardless of you having done enrollment or not allowing to defer, ask for extensions. I'm sure they would understand if you say you have no place to live. Going to classes is generally not mandatory here anyway so missing a lecture or 2 in situations like these would not be the end of the world for either university or you.
If you've honestly done all of the above and still you "Have" to be here because of maybe uni or something. Then yes. Ask in the group from seniors if anyone would be kind to host you(or find a temp private sublet maybe). Please remember, many seniors here are also students, maybe a year or so ahead of you but still students. It's hard as is to manage their day to day affairs, so if they are agreeing to host you, it's their generosity and should never be taken for granted.
