Heading 2: For CS, Are the courses practical to our field job in future or are they theoretical and very research oriented? Is the degree hectic like is it easy to manage a part time job?

Answer: The courses in MS CS are optional meaning nothing is a must to take. You have just have to fill in credits of some categories. In those categories multiple courses are offered each semester and you are free to take any.
Because of this freedom the work load, difficulty and practicality of courses is totally custom and depends upon you i.e what courses you take. You can pick out the most difficult courses and have a hellish time or you can pick out your interest ones or relatively straight forward ones and it becomes manageable
Overall i would say the courses quality is good here. It's not going to be easy pickings, you'll have to put in some effort but your course selection really matters.
