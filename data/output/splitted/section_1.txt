Heading 2: Few tips before you come here
Body:
* Start learning German as soon as possible. While it possible to **survive** without, it'll make your life much much easier if you can speak some of it. Not only this, but it'll help you in getting more jobs and B1 Level is a requirement when applying for P.R later anyways. Some useful platforms to learn german are [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) and [Busuu](http://busuu.com).
* Start looking for accomodations as soon as you can, preferably around 6 months before.
* Please delete all torrent softwares and everything related to it from your computers(More details in the [General Tips](#General-tips) section)
