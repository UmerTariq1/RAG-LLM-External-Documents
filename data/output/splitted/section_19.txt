Answer: Depends on your priorities. If you want to live in a outskirts of the city away from any noise then you might want to go for dudweiler. If you want to live in the city with the bus connections, shops and other social places nearby then you might prefer area near the city center.  Both sides have pros and cons.
- Living in dudweiler will mean cheaper accomodation, peacefullness and if you live in a dorm there then many other Pakistanis. The university is also nearer. But at the same time it will mean you might have to walk upto 10 ish min every time you wanna take a bus to go to somewhere.
- Living near the city center will mean nearby shops (and also some fast food places that are open till late night), more places to socialize, nearby bus stops and the usual hustle bustle. But living near the city center might cost you more money as rent is higher (around 50-100 euros more per month atleast).
