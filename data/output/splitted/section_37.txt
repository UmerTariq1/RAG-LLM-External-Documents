Heading 1: Jobs Advice 🏢
Heading 2: Odd jobs during studies
Body:
There are part time jobs available but most of them require German language. Especially if its a customer facing job. Non customer facing jobs ofc dont req German language proficiency.
There are opportunities to work in retails stores, restaurant, bakeries, or warehouses(but warehouse work is rare here, very few ppl have worked there)
In any case, it will always learning German as it will open far more opportunities specially in odd jobs
