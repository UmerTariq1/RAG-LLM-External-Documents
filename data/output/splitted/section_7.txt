Do below steps at 8am as there are more appointments available at that time. At 8am you can find an appointment within a few days while if you try at other times, you might not find any appointment for a month.
[**This link**](https://bit.ly/3OAbp8U) brings you to the page for making an appointment. It is in German only and a bit complicated, but we will try to run you through it (yuou can also use the web based translator to translate the page). Follow the below steps:
1) Under "Auswahl der Funktionseinheit" it says "**BÃœRGERAMT**", that's the office you need to go to, so you have to select that.
2) Here you have to choose what you need to do during your appointment. For getting registered in SaarbrÃ¼cken, you need to select "**Meldeangelegenheiten**". This opens a bunch of options, where you have to select how many of each options you need to use. In your case, I believe you need to select the "+" symbol at "**Wohnsitzanmeldung Zuzug aus dem Ausland**" (for registering you at the place you are staying after moving here from abroad) and then press "**WEITER**" at the end of the page. You then get an overview of what you have selected and what you need to bring (your passport, a document you get from your landlord that verifies that you live at that place, and something that identifies you as a person, such as a birth or wedding certificate, and I believe they need to see the original document of that stuff for some reason. Then, you press "**OK**" at the end of the page.
3) Now you need to choose where you want to go to this office. There is a map on that page that shows you where each office is located, so you can choose whatever is closest to you, or just choose whichever has any open time slots. Then you can select a time slot for this office.
4) Enter your personal information. Your first name at "Vorname", last name at "Nachname", email at, well, "E-Mail" and once again at "E-Mail - Wiederholung", then finally your phone number at "Telefonnummer". Then you need to check the box that this data can be used to create an appointment, after which you can press "**TERMIN RESERVIEREN**" at the end of the page.
