Price of the dorms are fixed (unless its being sublet, then some ppl sublet for it cheaper or higher. ask in the PSA group for current prices.
For the WGs, It depends on several factors like size of the room, wg or studio apartment, area, facilities etc.
As of writing this:
In the city, near the city center where most the WGs are available:
Studio apartment for around 500-600 warm rent is good. Only sbt dorm is cheaper where studio apartment is around 450.
For wg/share apartment: it depends on the number of ppl you are sharing it with. Most apartments here are for 3 ppl. Avg price would be around 350-450 depending on the size of the room and size of the overall apartment.
