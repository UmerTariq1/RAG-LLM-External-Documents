Heading 2: Finding Accomodation
Body:
- **Start applying/looking as soon as you can, preferably around 6 months before**.
- **Before signing any contract and making any payment it is recommended that you request someone here to go visit the place on your behalf. If someone insists on making the payment without even visiting the place, it is a clear red flag. Try to convince them you will handover deposit and rent in person when you are here.**.
Most of the students live in dorms. There are two types of dorms.
1) [University dorms](https://tl1host.eu/SWSB/#admission) (You can see the list of them and apply on that link)
2) [Private dorms](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/global/welcome-center/accommodation/private-dormitories.html)
- University dorms are usually the best option in terms of cost and living situation. But the waiting list is long, so apply as early in these as possible.
- Private dorms are *realatively* easier to get in as they have smaller waiting time. Since university dorms' applciation can take upto an year (as of writing this, Feb 2024).
- Refer to map A above to see where dorms are located in the city.
- For private dorms you will have to go to their respective website for their application. Some of them might only ask you to send an email to the manager there. That's ok. Just send them an email asking if there is a room available there.
