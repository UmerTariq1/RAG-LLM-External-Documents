Body:
If you have 6 months visa then apply for the residence permit in your 2nd or 3rd month. Email the university welcome centre to process your application, it gets done faster this way. Usually, Permit is given for 2 years but in the end, it depends on your Visa Officer (VO).
If you want to apply yourself then call the VO right at the starting time of the office (8am). Otherwise they dont usually pick up the call.
