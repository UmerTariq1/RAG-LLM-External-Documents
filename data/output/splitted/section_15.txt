Cusanushaus is a private dorm in SB near the city center. There are 3 different types of rooms in this dorm, whose details you can see on the website linked below. You can see dorm's exact location on the map linked in Life in Saarbrucken Section. To apply for this dorm follow this process.
1- Visit the official website: https://cusanustreff.de/
2- Explore the different rooms. The rooms are of three categories and each has two variants i.e. with and without a toilet inside.
3- Download the from the website and duly fill it.
4- Send the form on the mentioned email and the landlord will put your name in the queue.
Cusanushaus offers one of the most convenient and cheapest locations you'll find in the city center. There are three bus stations within 3 minutes of foot. 3 different grocery stores under 10 minutes on foot, one of which is just 2 minutes away. The view is amazing, you can see the Saar river right from your room's window (if you get a room on the roadside facing). The city center is under 5 minutes on foot, the main train station at around 8-10 minutes on foot.. you get the point.
Rent starts at 290 euros for the smallest rooms without toilet, from there you add around 30 euros for everything you add on top.
Lastly, one of the main "issues" of such a dorm is the shared kitchen and shared washrooms (including toilets). The main kitchen, including the main fridge but tenants usually buy a small fridge for their room, is shared among the entire floor consisting around 12-15 tenants. According to the Pakistani tenants living there, its rather rare that you find the kitchen completely busy and you have to wait for your turn to cook, very few people actually cook but this can vary. There are two toilets and a dedicated shower area on each end of the hallway. These are shared among (roughly) 6-8 people.
The cleaning of these shared spaces is handled by the cleaning staff. They clean the toilets, shower, kitchen and the hallway in the morning of every week day.
If you are unsure about anything, feel free to reachout to any of the seniors already living there to clear out any confussion.

You can also look for Wohngemeinschaft (WG - *pronounced as WheyGhey*). WGs are shared apartments where you live with other apartment-mates. In this case you have a shared kitchen and bathroom among the apartment mates.
You can look for WGs on [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de) or [Ebay Klein](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/saarbruecken/) or [Immobilien Scout](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/).
