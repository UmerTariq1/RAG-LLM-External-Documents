Heading 2: Importance of German
Body:
(to be written in detail)
As with any country, native language is important if you want to find a job there. Even though it is relatively easy to find an IT job here which doesnt require German, Knowing German would help A LOT. Roughly 50% jobs (both student and full time jobs) require german and that is for CS. For other fields the percentage might be way higher. And German is almost always needed if you want to find a part time non technical odd job here. There are some instances where you wouldnt need it, for eg cases where you dont need to face the customer, but those jobs are rare and readily available.
Also, Knowing German would generally help you a lot in daily life. For example socializing and etc.
University offers langauge courses for free. I would suggest taking them every semester.
After two years you will already be around B1 which is quite good and min required limit for passport as well.
