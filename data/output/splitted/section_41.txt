Heading 1: About
Heading 2: Is it okay to arrive after the "last date to arrive" ?
Body:
While it's certainly ok to arrive late. Here educatiom system will not force you to be punctual and take classes(no attendance etc) so you have to be self disciplined and hence we won't recommend being very chill about stuff.
Also, moving abroad and living alone for the first time takes some time to get used to. So if you arrive late then it might get hectic for you to manage classes and getting used to here.
Its suggested to arrive before the classes start so you get settled here before the 'magic' starts.
