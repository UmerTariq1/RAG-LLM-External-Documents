Heading 2: Applying for fiktionsbescheinigung
Body:
The Fiktionsbescheinigung is a proof that you can stay in Germany without a residence permit. Itâ€™s just a piece of paper. You get it while you wait for another residence permit.
With a Fiktionsbescheinigung, you can:
* Stay in Germany after your visa or residence permit expires
* Continue your work, studies or self-employment.
* In some cases, travel outside Germany
How to get it? Ask for it. Call or email your VO. If you are calling then call in the early office hours.
